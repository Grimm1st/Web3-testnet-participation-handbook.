# 🔐 Wallet Setup & Testnet Network Configuration

This section explains how to prepare a crypto wallet for interacting with Web3 testnet environments.

A dedicated testnet wallet is strongly recommended to avoid any risk to real assets.

---

## 1. Choose a Wallet

Common wallets for testnet usage:

- MetaMask (EVM-based networks)
- Phantom (Solana-based)
- OKX Wallet
- Rabby Wallet

Use browser extension versions for full compatibility.

## 2. Create a Testnet Wallet

Steps:
1. Install the wallet extension.
2. Create a new wallet.
3. Securely store the seed phrase offline.
4. Do NOT reuse mainnet wallets.

---

## 3. Add Testnet Network

If the network is not automatically available:

Add it manually using:
- Network name
- RPC URL
- Chain ID
- Currency symbol
- Block explorer URL

These parameters are usually provided in the project's documentation.

---

## 4. Switch to Testnet Mode

Some wallets require enabling testnets:
- MetaMask → Settings → Advanced → Enable Test Networks

Make sure you are not connected to mainnet.

---

## 5. Verify Connection

To verify:
- Open the official block explorer
- Paste your address
- Confirm network matches testnet

---

## 6. Security Notes

Best practices:
- Never share private keys
- Never sign unknown messages
- Avoid fake faucets
- Use hardware wallet only for mainnet

---

## Summary

A properly configured wallet is the foundation of all testnet interactions.
Without correct network setup, all further testing becomes unreliable.
